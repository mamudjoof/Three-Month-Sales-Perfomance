# Analysis of Supermarket Sales Data Over Three Months

# INTRODUCTION
The aim of this project is to explore, visualize, and derive insights from supermarket sales data over a three-month period.
The primary focus is on understanding sales patterns, revenue and which branches is doing well at which hour and making informed business decisions based on data.
In the competitive retail industry, understanding sales trends and customer preferences is crucial for optimizing operations and maximizing profitability. 
This project utilizes sales data from a supermarket to answer key business questions about customer origins, branch distribution, revenue, production lines, sales days and hours, payment methods, and city sales.

# METHODOLOGY
This project follows a structured data analysis process to extract insights from supermarket sales data covering the months of January, February, and March. The dataset includes transactional records from three branches: Alman, Catana, and Isana. The methodology is divided into the following steps:

# 1. Data Collection and Preparation
The data was sourced from a supermarket's point-of-sale system and includes attributes such as transaction dates, unit price, branch locations, product lines, quantities sold, revenues, and payment methods. The data was cleaned and standardized in Microsoft Excel to ensure consistency in formats (e.g., currency, dates etc) and to handle any missing or incorrect entries.
# 2. Data Exploration
Initial exploration was performed to understand the structure and key variables of the dataset. This included:
- Identifying the number of transactions per branch and month.
- Categorizing sales by product line and city.
- Reviewing customer payment preferences.

# 3. Data Aggregation and Analysis
Data was grouped and aggregated to answer key business questions:
- Total Revenue by Month and Branch: Calculated to determine monthly performance. January recorded the highest revenue across all branches, with Catana (€38,509), Alman (€36,839), and Isana (€35,865) each performing well.
- Quantity Orders Per Hour: Analyzed hourly trends, showing peak order times between 13:00 and 15:00, especially in Alman.
- Revenue by Product Line: Electronic accessories emerged as the highest-selling product category in terms of quantity (971 units) and generated a revenue of £51,750.03.
- Payment Method Preferences: Payment distribution revealed E-wallet (35%) as the most preferred method, followed by Cash (34%) and Credit Card (31%).
- Revenue by Day: Weekday sales analysis showed consistent revenue with slightly higher performance on weekdays than weekends.

# 4. Visualization
Visualizations were created using Excel dashboards to present:
- Monthly revenue trends,
- Hourly sales patterns,
- Payment method breakdowns,
- Product line performance,
- Branch comparisons,
- City-wise quantity sold.

These charts enabled better interpretation and communication of insights.

# 5. Conclusion
From the analysis, we concluded:
- January was the most profitable month across all branches.
- Electronic accessories were the most lucrative product line.
- E-wallet is the most preferred payment method.
- Afternoon hours saw the highest volume of transactions.
- Sales were relatively balanced across weekdays, with minor variations.
  
# Recommendations to Improve Sales in Other Branches
Adopt Best Practices from High-Performing Branches (e.g., Alman in January), analyze what marketing strategies, product placements, or seasonal promotions Alman used during January. Replicate those successful strategies in Catana and Isana, especially during lower-performing months. Optimize Staffing and Promotions During Peak Hours. Since the highest order volumes occur between 13:00 and 15:00, ensure all branches are fully staffed and well-stocked during these hours. Since some Product Lines such as electronic accessories had the highest sales volume and revenue. Encourage other branches to promote these products more prominently. Offer bundle deals or loyalty points for repeated purchases.

Analyze City-Based Preferences and Customize Offerings, since cities like Manhattan, Baston, and Red City show higher quantities sold, determine what specific products sell well in those regions. Tailor inventory and promotions in each branch based on the city's customer preferences and demographics. While weekday sales are fairly balanced, more targeted weekday promotions (e.g., Tuesday Treats, Wednesday Deals) could create a consistent sales lift. Use SMS/email marketing to notify regular customers of branch-specific weekday promotions.
